Stock Valuation Algorithm

Quick and Dirty Stock Valuation Algorithm

Short dirty written ages ago sanity-check-style command line php based stock evaluator. Returns "value" 0 - 27 and some relevant data from yahoo unofficial finance API. 

27 is the highest value. It has helped me to avoid mistakes before clicking "buy".
